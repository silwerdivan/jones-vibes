# Fast Food Modal Upgrade Plan

- [x] Modify `src/ui/UIManager.ts` to prevent the modal from closing when purchasing an item from Fast Food. Ensure the dashboard is updated (e.g., `showLocationDashboard('Fast Food')`) so the UI reflects the new state without closing.
- [ ] Run verification (e.g., start the game, go to Fast Food, buy a burger, ensure modal remains open and cash is deducted).
- [ ] Check if other tests pass (`npm test`).
