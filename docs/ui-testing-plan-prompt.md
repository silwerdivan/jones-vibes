**Role:** You are an expert QA engineer specializing in modern front-end and user interface testing.

**Context:** I have a small MVP of a game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game currently has no automated UI tests, which is making it difficult to add new features and fix bugs confidently without introducing regressions. The goal of this first step is to analyze the provided code and create a comprehensive plan for the UI tests that need to be written.

**Task:** Your primary task is to act as a QA architect and create a detailed testing plan. This plan should outline the necessary UI tests to ensure the game's user interface is functioning correctly and is robust against regressions. You are not to write any test code in this step.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Analyze the Code:** Carefully review the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to understand the game's structure, UI components, and user interactions.
2.  **Identify Key UI Components and Interactions:** Based on your analysis, identify all the interactive UI elements and the core user flows of the game.
3.  **Acknowledge the Current Testing Framework:** The project will use its current testing framework, **[Enter Your Current Testing Framework Here, e.g., "Jest with Testing Library"]**. All test cases should be planned with this framework in mind. You do not need to recommend a new one.
4.  **Outline Test Suites:** Structure the testing plan into logical test suites. For each suite, provide a clear description of the feature or component it covers.
5.  **Detail Test Cases:** Within each test suite, list the specific test cases that should be implemented. For each test case, provide a descriptive name and a brief explanation of what it should verify. Consider positive paths, negative paths, and edge cases.

**Constraints:**

*   The output should be a testing plan, not executable test code.
*   The plan should be easy to understand for a developer with some testing experience.
*   The suggested tests should be practical for an MVP stage of a project.

**Output Format:**

Please generate your response as a single Markdown document titled `ui-testing-plan.md`. The content within the document should use checkboxes for each test case so progress can be tracked. It should be structured as follows:
