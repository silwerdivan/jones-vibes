## Identified Gaps for New UI Features

### 1. Bottom Tab Bar (App-like Navigation)
*   **City:** Needs `map`, `location_city`, or a custom "City Grid" icon.
*   **Life:** Needs `person`, `favorite`, or a custom "Bio-metrics" icon.
*   **Inventory:** Needs `inventory_2` or a custom "Cyber-deck" icon.
*   **Social:** Needs `groups` or a custom "Comms" icon.
*   **Menu:** Needs `menu` or a custom "System" icon.

### 2. Life Dashboard (Goal Gauges)
*   **Wealth:** Needs `payments` or a custom "Credits" icon.
*   **Happiness:** Needs `mood` or a custom "Smile-chip" icon.
*   **Education:** Needs `school` (distinct from "Take Course") or `psychology`.
*   **Career:** Needs `military_tech` (Rank) or a custom "Ladder" icon.

### 3. News Ticker
*   **Alert/News:** Needs `campaign`, `rss_feed`, or a custom "Signal" icon.

### 4. Bento Grid (Locations)
Each location needs a distinct, high-quality icon/illustration:
*   **Home:** `home` / Apartment icon.
*   **Employment Agency:** `handshake` / Agency icon.
*   **Community College:** `university` / Neural-link icon.
*   **Shopping Mall:** `shopping_cart` / Market icon.
*   **Used Car Lot:** `garage` / Vehicle icon.
*   **Bank:** `savings` / Vault icon.

## Conclusion
The current Material Icons are too generic and "flat" for the intended high-fidelity Cyberpunk aesthetic. The next step is to source or create custom SVG icons that feature:
1.  **Neon Accents:** Glowing edges.
2.  **Glassmorphism:** Semi-transparent backgrounds.
3.  **Thematic Resonance:** Symbols that evoke a high-tech/low-life future (e.g., chips instead of books, credits instead of coins).
