Of course. It's frustrating when a seemingly small change impacts playability. After a thorough review of the codebase, the completed tasks, and your new requirements, I've identified the root cause of the AI issue and created a comprehensive action plan.

The game is unplayable due to a combination of a small but critical typo introduced in the last update and a logic issue where the AI's turn ends prematurely for actions that don't consume in-game time.

This plan will first guide you to fix these stability issues and then walk you through implementing the responsive design features outlined in the requirements document (`0001-prd-responsive-evolution.md`). The steps are ordered from most critical to least, ensuring a stable foundation before adding new features.

### **Part 1: Critical Bug Fixes & AI Logic Enhancement**

**Goal:** Make the game stable and playable by fixing the AI crash and improving its turn logic.

*   [ ] **Step 1.1: Fix Game-Crashing Typo in AI Action Handling**
    *   **File:** `js/game/GameState.js`
    *   **Context:** When the AI decides to buy a car, the `handleAIAction` method attempts to call `this.buyCar(action.car)`. The variable `action` does not exist in this context, which causes a script error and halts all further AI processing, freezing the game.
    *   **Task:** Locate the `handleAIAction` method. Inside the `switch` statement, find the `case 'buyCar':` block. Change the line `this.buyCar(action.car);` to `this.buyCar();`.

*   [ ] **Step 1.2: Allow AI to Continue Turn After Zero-Time Actions**
    *   **File:** `js/game/GameState.js`
    *   **Context:** The current logic ends the AI's turn after it buys an item or a car. These actions don't use any of the player's `time`. The AI should be able to perform these actions and then continue its turn to do something else, like travel or work. This addresses your observation that the AI ends its turn with time remaining.
    *   **Task:** In the `handleAIAction` method, find the `case 'buyItem':` block and replace `this.endTurn();` with `setTimeout(() => this.processAITurn(), 1000);`. Repeat this exact change for the `case 'buyCar':` block.

### **Part 2: Foundational Responsive Layout**

**Goal:** Implement the basic CSS changes to make the game layout adapt to smaller screens, as described in "Option 1" of the requirements document.

*   [ ] **Step 2.1: Create the Mobile Media Query**
    *   **File:** `style.css`
    *   **Task:** At the very bottom of the file, add a new media query block: `@media (max-width: 768px) { ... }`. All subsequent CSS changes in this section will go inside this block.

*   [ ] **Step 2.2: Stack the Main Grid Vertically**
    *   **File:** `style.css`
    *   **Task:** Inside the new media query, create a rule for the `.main-grid` class. Set `grid-template-columns` to `1fr` and redefine `grid-template-areas` to stack the panels in this order: `"player1"`, `"player2"`, `"info"`, `"actions"`, `"log"`.

*   [ ] **Step 2.3: Increase Button Touch Target Size**
    *   **File:** `style.css`
    *   **Task:** Inside the media query, create a rule for the `button` element. Increase its `padding` (e.g., `1rem`), `font-size` (e.g., `1.2rem`), and set a `min-height` of `44px` to make buttons easier to press on a touch device.

### **Part 3: Enhanced Mobile User Experience**

**Goal:** Refine the mobile experience with a more accessible action panel and clearer modals, as described in "Option 2" of the requirements document.

*   [ ] **Step 3.1: Convert Action Panel to a Sticky Footer**
    *   **File:** `style.css`
    *   **Task:** Inside the media query, target the `.action-buttons` class. Add the following properties: `position: sticky;`, `bottom: 0;`, `background-color: var(--panel-bg);`, and `z-index: 10;`. Also add a `padding` to give the buttons some space and a `border-top` to distinguish the footer from the content above it.

*   [ ] **Step 3.2: Prevent Sticky Footer from Overlapping the Log**
    *   **File:** `style.css`
    *   **Task:** Inside the media query, target the `.main-grid` class again. Add a `padding-bottom` (e.g., `6rem`) to create empty space at the end of the grid, ensuring the event log can be fully scrolled into view without being hidden by the new sticky footer.

*   [ ] **Step 3.3: Adapt Choice Modal for Mobile Screens**
    *   **File:** `style.css`
    *   **Task:** Inside the media query, create a rule for `#choice-modal`. Set its `width` to `95vw` to make it almost full-screen. Add another rule for buttons inside the modal (`#choice-modal button`) and set their `width` to `100%` and add a vertical `margin` (e.g., `0.5rem 0`) to stack them neatly.

### **Part 4: Architectural Decoupling (EventBus)**

**Goal:** Implement the full architectural refactor from "Option 3" of the requirements. This decouples the game logic from the UI, making the code more maintainable. The current codebase already includes `EventBus.js` and uses it, so these steps will focus on refining that implementation to achieve complete decoupling.

*   [ ] **Step 4.1: Ensure Initial State is Published Automatically**
    *   **File:** `js/game/GameState.js`
    *   **Context:** For true decoupling, the UI should render itself based on an initial event, rather than being told to render manually from `app.js`.
    *   **Task:** At the very end of the `constructor` in the `GameState` class, add the following line: `EventBus.publish('stateChanged', this);`.

*   [ ] **Step 4.2: Remove Manual Initial Render Call**
    *   **File:** `js/app.js`
    *   **Context:** Now that `GameState` announces its own creation, the manual render call in the `main` function is no longer needed.
    *   **Task:** In the `main` function, find and delete the line `gameView.render(gameState);`.

*   [ ] **Step 4.3: Solidify the UI's Subscription Model**
    *   **File:** `js/ui.js`
    *   **Task:** No code changes are needed here. Simply verify that the `GameView` constructor contains the line `EventBus.subscribe('stateChanged', (gameState) => { this.render(gameState); });`. This confirms the UI is correctly set up to react to any and all state changes published by the `GameState`.

By following these steps sequentially, you will first create a playable and stable game, then layer on a robust, responsive design and conclude with a cleaner, more professional architecture.
