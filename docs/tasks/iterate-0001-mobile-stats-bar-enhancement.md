Thanks for sharing the Readme, architecture notes, and the two UI mockups. From what you described (desktop clearly shows all stats, mobile hides the AI’s stats and the title wastes space), you’re spot on about the UX gap on mobile. The architecture already has a solid responsive foundation, so this is a great place to build a targeted mobile enhancement without overhauling the whole system.

Here’s a practical plan to improve mobile usability while keeping the desktop UX intact. I’ll also include patch-ready code snippets you can drop into your repo.

What I’m proposing at a glance
- Make mobile stats more visible without scrolling: add a compact, persistent mobile stats bar that shows essential metrics for both players (including the AI player).
- Trim the title space on mobile (either shrink or hide the title in mobile view) to reclaim vertical space for the important stats.
- Keep the existing responsive grid for desktop, but ensure mobile has a clear, quick-glance view of both players’ status.
- Keep the architecture you documented (EventBus, decoupled UI, Command pattern) intact; this is purely a presentation/UX optimization.

Concrete patch plan (with code you can copy-paste)

1) Add a mobile stats bar in the HTML
- Purpose: Always-visible, compact snapshot of both players’ key metrics on small screens.
- Where: Inside the main container, near the top, so it doesn’t scroll away.

Patch: index.html (insert after the game title or near the top of .game-container)
```html
<!-- MOBILE CONTEXT: compact status bar for mobile (visible on small screens) -->
<div id="mobile-stats" class="mobile-stats" aria-label="Mobile quick stats" hidden>
  <div class="mobile-card" id="mobile-p1">
    <div class="mobile-title">Player 1</div>
    <div class="mobile-content">
      Cash: <span id="mobile-p1-cash">$0</span><br/>
      Happiness: <span id="mobile-p1-happiness">0</span><br/>
      Time: <span id="mobile-p1-time">24</span>h
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="mobile-card" id="mobile-p2">
    <div class="mobile-title">Player 2</div>
    <div class="mobile-content">
      Cash: <span id="mobile-p2-cash">$0</span><br/>
      Happiness: <span id="mobile-p2-happiness">0</span><br/>
      Time: <span id="mobile-p2-time">24</span>h
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Note: You can start hidden via the hidden attribute and reveal it in CSS/JS for mobile. This keeps the initial DOM lean on desktop and avoids layout thrash if you don’t want it visible there.

2) Style the mobile bar (and optionally shrink/hide the title on mobile)
- Purpose: Make the bar look neon-y, readable, and space-efficient; remove title clutter on mobile if desired.

Patch: style.css
- Add base styles for the mobile bar, and then a media query for small screens.

```css
/* NEW: mobile quick stats bar (hidden by default) */
.mobile-stats {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 8px;
  padding: 6px;
  margin-bottom: 8px;
  z-index: 5;
}

.mobile-card {
  background: rgba(21, 4, 42, 0.92);
  border: 1px solid #00FFFF;
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 6px 8px;
  font-family: var(--font-body);
  font-size: 0.85rem;
  color: #EDEFF4;
}

.mobile-title {
  font-weight: bold;
  font-family: var(--font-header);
  color: #FF0;
  font-size: 0.75rem;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  margin-bottom: 4px;
}

/* MOBILE LAYOUT: show mobile stats and shrink/hide title to save space */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  /* show the mobile stats bar; you can toggle visibility as needed */
  #mobile-stats { display: grid; }

  .main-grid {
    padding-bottom: 8rem; /* room for sticky mobile actions if you keep them */
  }

  /* Option A: hide the big title on narrow screens to reclaim space
     (disable this block if you prefer to keep the title visible) */
  .game-title {
    display: none;
  }

  /* Optional: ensure buttons are easy to tap on mobile (already in your CSS) */
  button {
    min-height: 44px;
  }
}
```

3) Update the GameView to populate the mobile bar
- Purpose: Keep the mobile stats bar in sync with the main UI so players get a real-time glance at both players’ status.

Patch: js/ui.js
- Extend the constructor to grab the new DOM elements, and update render() to refresh the mobile stats.

Add in the constructor, after you cache the other DOM nodes:
```javascript
// NEW: mobile quick stats nodes
this.mobileP1Cash = document.getElementById('mobile-p1-cash');
this.mobileP1Happiness = document.getElementById('mobile-p1-happiness');
this.mobileP1Time = document.getElementById('mobile-p1-time');
this.mobileP2Cash = document.getElementById('mobile-p2-cash');
this.mobileP2Happiness = document.getElementById('mobile-p2-happiness');
this.mobileP2Time = document.getElementById('mobile-p2-time');

// Make sure the mobile stats block is visible on mobile (optional)
try {
  const smallScreen = window.matchMedia('(max-width: 768px)').matches;
  if (smallScreen) {
    this.modalOverlay && this.modalOverlay.classList.remove('hidden'); // if you want to init visible for mobile
  }
} catch (e) {
  // no-op
}
```

Then, in render(gameState), after you update the regular stats, also refresh the mobile ones:
```javascript
    // Mobile quick stats (visible on small screens)
    const p1 = gameState.players[0];
    if (this.mobileP1Cash) this.mobileP1Cash.textContent = `$${p1.cash}`;
    if (this.mobileP1Happiness) this.mobileP1Happiness.textContent = p1.happiness;
    if (this.mobileP1Time) this.mobileP1Time.textContent = `${p1.time}`;

    if (gameState.players.length > 1) {
      const p2 = gameState.players[1];
      if (this.mobileP2Cash) this.mobileP2Cash.textContent = `$${p2.cash}`;
      if (this.mobileP2Happiness) this.mobileP2Happiness.textContent = p2.happiness;
      if (this.mobileP2Time) this.mobileP2Time.textContent = `${p2.time}`;
    }
```

4) Make sure the modal, actions, and AI loading remain unaffected
- The mobile UX patch focuses on visibility and density, not behavior. Your existing modal, input flows, and AI loading overlay can stay as-is.
- If you want to also enhance mobile UX further, you can convert the actions panel to a sticky bottom bar (as you already started in the CSS) and ensure the mobile stats bar remains visible above it.

Optional alternative: a “compact accordion” for stats
- If you’d rather not add a second row on mobile, you can implement a simple accordion per player to toggle visibility of details. That would allow you to keep the title and the two player panels on a narrow screen while exposing the AI stats on demand.
- Implementation notes: add small toggle buttons or a segmented control at the top; show/hide Player 1 or Player 2 details in the UI sections.

Why this approach fits your architecture and goals
- It uses your existing EventBus-driven, unidirectional data flow. The mobile bar is simply another UI view of the same game state.
- No changes to the game logic or AI, just presentation. This minimizes risk.
- You preserve desktop fidelity (no regressions) while significantly improving mobile visibility and usability.
- It aligns with the architecture in gemini.md/readme.md: responsive UI, cross-device compatibility, and a clean separation of concerns (View reacts to state; Input/Controller mutate state; State publishes changes).

What you’ll want to test
- Desktop: ensure the new mobile bar doesn’t affect the existing layout (it’s hidden by CSS on desktop by default).
- Mobile: verify the mobile stats bar shows up, updates after each action, and that the title space is reclaimed as intended.
- AI turns: confirm the loading overlay still shows during AI thinking and search/execute flow remains intact.
- Accessibility: ensure the mobile stats div has proper aria-labels and is keyboard-navigable if you add any interactivity.

A quick “lint-and-run” checklist
- Ensure the new DOM IDs (mobile-p1-*, mobile-p2-*) don’t collide with existing IDs.
- If you’re using a bundler or a linter, add a small test to render the GameState and ensure the UI updates the mobile stats block after a state change.
- If you choose to hide the title on mobile (as in the patch), verify the visual density remains acceptable on mid-size devices (tablets) where the 768px breakpoint might be crossed.

Summary
- You’re right about the mobile UX gap: AI stats hidden, title taking space.
- The proposed patch adds a compact mobile stats bar for both players, optionally hides the title on mobile, and keeps your responsive architecture intact.
- It’s a small, low-risk enhancement with high payoff in usability.

If you’d like, I can tailor the patch to your preferred approach (always-on mobile bar vs. a toggle, keep/hide title vs. shrink, etc.) and provide a single combined diff for all three files (HTML, CSS, JS) ready to paste into your repo. I can also propose a quick follow-up variant that uses a single, horizontally-scrollable mobile stats strip if you want to avoid multiple cards stacking.
