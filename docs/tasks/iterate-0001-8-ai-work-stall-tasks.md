Of course. It appears the recent refactoring introduced a critical regression in the AI's turn-handling logic, causing the game to stall. The AI performs a single action that consumes time, but the game loop doesn't correctly prompt it for its next action, nor does it end the AI's turn.

Here is a detailed, step-by-step plan to fix the AI, address underlying architectural gaps, and ensure the game is fully playable again.

### [x] **Part 1: Fix the Critical AI Loop Bug**

The core problem is that when the AI successfully performs an action that takes time (like `workShift` or `takeCourse`), the logic to continue or end its turn is not executed. This leaves the game waiting for an AI action that will never come.

#### [x] **Step 1: Unify the AI's Action-Continuation Logic in `GameState.js`**

The `handleAIAction` method in `GameState.js` currently has inconsistent logic. Some actions (like `travel`) correctly re-trigger the AI's turn, while others (like `workShift`) do not. We need to refactor this into a single, reliable pattern.

1.  **Modify `handleAIAction` to Capture Action Success:**
    *   Inside the `handleAIAction` method, declare a `let success = false;` variable at the top.
    *   Go through every `case` in the `switch` statement. Instead of calling `setTimeout` or `endTurn` inside each `case`, simply have it call the relevant game state method and store the `true`/`false` result in the `success` variable.
    *   For example, `case 'workShift': success = this.workShift(); break;` and `case 'travel': success = this.travel(aiAction.params.destination); break;`.

2. [x] **Create a Centralized Post-Action Check:**
    *   After the `switch` statement, create a new `if/else` block that decides what to do next based on the `success` variable and the AI player's remaining time.
    *   **If `success` is `true` AND the current player has time remaining (`this.getCurrentPlayer().time > 0`):**
        *   Log that the action was successful and the AI is deciding its next move.
        *   Call `setTimeout(() => this.processAITurn(), 1000);` to continue the AI's turn.
    *   **Else (if the action `failed` OR the player is out of time):**
        *   Log why the turn is ending (e.g., "AI action failed..." or "AI is out of time...").
        *   Call `this.endTurn();` to properly pass control to the next player.

This change ensures that after *every* AI action, there is a consistent, centralized check that either continues the AI's turn or ends it, fixing the game-halting bug.

### [x] **Part 2: Improve AI Behavior and Debugging**

With the main bug fixed, we can make the AI smarter and the game easier to debug.

#### [x] **Step 1: Prevent AI from Getting Stuck on Failing Actions**

The current `AIController` might repeatedly suggest an action that the `GameState` knows will fail (e.g., trying to take a course it can't afford). The fix in Part 1 prevents an infinite loop in a single turn, but we can improve the AI's logic.

1.  **Add a "Pass Turn" Fallback to `AIController.js`:**
    *   In `AIController.js`, modify the final catch-all action. Instead of always defaulting to `workShift`, check if working a shift is actually possible (e.g., is the AI at the 'Employment Agency'?).
    *   If the default action isn't possible, have the AI return a new, explicit "pass" action, like `{ action: 'pass' }`.

2.  **Handle the "Pass" Action in `GameState.js`:**
    *   In the `handleAIAction` method's `switch` statement, add a `case 'pass':`.
    *   In this new case, simply log that the "AI chooses to pass" and let the logic fall through to the post-action check, which will then correctly end the turn.

#### [x] **Step 2: Enhance Logging for Better Clarity**

When an action fails, it's not always clear why. Improving the log messages will make testing and future development much easier.

1.  **Add Specific Failure Reasons in `GameState.js`:**
    *   Review all action methods (`workShift`, `takeCourse`, `travel`, etc.).
    *   Before any `return false;` statement, ensure a descriptive log message is added explaining the reason for the failure (e.g., "Not enough time to travel.", "Cannot afford to buy a car."). The code already does this in most places, but this is a good opportunity to verify it's done everywhere.
2.  **Improve AI Action Logging:**
    *   In `handleAIAction`, enhance the initial log message to include any parameters. For instance, instead of "AI decides to: travel", log "AI decides to travel to Community College."

### [x] **Part 3: Address Architectural Regressions and Gaps**

The previous work introduced a robust Observer pattern but left some minor architectural issues unresolved.

#### [x] **Step 1: Resolve the Circular Dependency in `app.js`**

The initialization in `app.js` is overly complex because `GameView` needs a `GameController`, and `GameController` needs a `GameView`. This can be simplified.

1.  **Refactor `GameView` Initialization:**
    *   Remove the `gameController` parameter from the `GameView` constructor. The view should not need to know about the controller to be built. Its only job is to subscribe to the `EventBus` and render state changes.
2.  **Refactor `GameController` Initialization:**
    *   The `GameController`'s purpose is to handle user input and trigger state changes. It needs the `GameState` to modify it and the `GameView` to display modals for choices. The current constructor `(gameState, gameView)` is correct.
3.  **Simplify the `main` Function in `app.js`:**
    *   The initialization order should be clean and linear:
        1.  Instantiate `GameState`.
        2.  Instantiate `GameView`.
        3.  Instantiate `GameController`, passing it the `gameState` and `gameView` instances.
        4.  Instantiate `InputManager`, passing it the `gameController`.
        5.  Call `inputManager.initialize()`.
    *   The `EventBus` handles the connection from `GameState` to `GameView`, so no manual "publish initial state" call is needed, as the `GameState` constructor already handles it.

By completing these steps, you will resolve the critical bug preventing the AI from playing, make its behavior more robust, and clean up the remaining architectural inconsistencies, resulting in a stable and playable game.
