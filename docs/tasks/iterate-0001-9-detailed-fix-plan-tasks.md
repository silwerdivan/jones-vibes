Looking at the code and the reported bug that the travel button isn't visible when the game starts, I've identified several critical issues and gaps. Here's a detailed way forward:
CRITICAL BUG FIXES NEEDED IMMEDIATELY
Bug 1: Travel Button Not Visible at Start
The root cause is a mismatch between Player's initial location ("Home") and the LOCATIONS array which doesn't include "Home". This breaks the travel functionality from the start.
Bug 2: Missing Active Player Visual Indicator
The CSS has .active styles for player panels but no code actually adds/removes this class when turns change.
Bug 3: Missing Initial Game Rendering
While EventBus.publish('stateChanged', this) is called in GameState constructor, this happens BEFORE GameView subscribes to the event, so the initial state is never rendered.

DETAILED FIX IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
Phase 1: Fix Critical Game-Breaking Bugs
- [x] Step 1: Fix Location System Consistency & Initial Render Timing

* Problem: Player starts at "Home" but LOCATIONS array starts with "Home", "Employment Agency"... - verify this is correctly aligned
* Solution: Ensure Player's initial location matches a valid location in LOCATIONS array
* Where: Check Player.js constructor and gameData.js LOCATIONS array
* Test: Verify travel button shows destinations excluding current location

- [x] Step 2: Add Active Player Highlighting

* Problem: No visual indication of whose turn it is
* Solution: Add/remove 'active' class on player panels during render
* Where: In ui.js render() method, add logic to apply 'active' class to current player's panel
* Implementation:

Remove 'active' from both panels
Add 'active' to panel matching currentPlayerIndex

Phase 2: Fix AI Turn Behavior
- [x] Step 3: Fix AI Turn Continuation Logic

* Problem: AI may get stuck or not properly continue/end turns
* Solution: Review the success/failure pattern in handleAIAction
* Where: GameState.js handleAIAction method
* Verify:

Actions that cost 0 time (like travel with car) should allow AI to continue
Failed actions should end turn properly
Log messages should clearly indicate what's happening

- [x] Step 4: Add AI Action Validation

* Problem: AI might attempt invalid actions repeatedly
* Solution: Add pre-validation in AIController before suggesting actions
* Where: AIController.js takeTurn method
* Implementation: Check if player has enough resources/time before suggesting an action

Phase 3: Complete Mobile Responsiveness
- [x] Step 5: Fix Action Panel Mobile Layout

* Problem: Action buttons panel needs better mobile positioning
* Current State: CSS has sticky footer style but may conflict with grid layout
* Solution: Ensure action panel properly detaches from grid on mobile
* Implementation:

Verify the sticky positioning works correctly
Add proper z-index layering
Test button visibility and accessibility

- [x] Step 6: Improve Touch Interaction

* Problem: No touch-specific handling for mobile devices
* Solution: Add touch event support in InputManager
* Where: InputManager.js
* Implementation:

Detect touch capability
Add touchstart listeners for immediate response
Prevent double-firing of events

- [x] Step 7: Fix Modal Responsiveness

* Problem: Choice modal needs full-screen mobile optimization
* Current State: Some CSS exists but incomplete
* Solution: Enhance modal mobile styles
* Implementation:

Make modal truly full-screen on mobile
Ensure input fields are properly sized for touch
Add proper spacing between buttons

Phase 4: Complete Core Game Loop
- [x] Step 8: Implement End Turn Time/Money Management

* Problem: endTurn method seems incomplete (comments suggest missing logic)
* Solution: Complete the daily expense, interest, and time reset logic
* Where: GameState.js endTurn method
* Implementation:

Apply daily expenses
Calculate and apply interest on loans
Reset time for next turn
Update location if needed

- [x] Step 9: Add Win Condition Checking

* Problem: checkWinCondition exists but is never called
* Solution: Check win condition after each action
* Where: Add to endTurn or after each successful action
* Implementation:

Check after AI completes turn
Check after human completes action
Display win message and end game

Phase 5: Polish and Stabilization
- [x] Step 10: Improve Log Readability

* Problem: Log messages may be too technical
* Solution: Make messages more player-friendly
* Implementation:

Use player names consistently
Format money values consistently
Add color coding for different message types

- [x] Step 11: Add Loading States

* Problem: No feedback during AI thinking time
* Solution: Add visual indicators during AI processing
* Implementation:

Disable buttons during AI turn
Add "thinking" animation or message
Show progress for multi-step AI actions

TESTING CHECKLIST
After implementing fixes, verify:

1. 
Game Starts Properly

Travel button is visible
Initial stats display correctly
Current location shows properly

2. 
Human Turn Works

All location-specific buttons appear/hide correctly
Modal choices work properly
Actions update state correctly

3. 
AI Turn Works

AI takes actions automatically
AI doesn't get stuck in loops
AI ends turn properly

4. 
Mobile Experience

Layout stacks vertically

Modals are full-screen
No horizontal scrolling

5. 
Game Progression

Education advances properly
Career progression works
Money calculations are correct
Win conditions trigger

PRIORITY ORDER

1. IMMEDIATE: Fix Steps 1-2 (Location system, Initial render, Active player)
2. HIGH: Fix Steps 3-4 (AI behavior)
3. MEDIUM: Fix Steps 5-7 (Mobile responsiveness)
4. LOW: Fix Steps 8-11 (Game loop completion and polish)

Start with the immediate fixes to get the game playable, then address AI issues, followed by mobile improvements.
