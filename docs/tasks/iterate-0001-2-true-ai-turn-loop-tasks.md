Of course. After a thorough analysis of the requirements, the completed tasks, and the current state of the codebase, I have identified the root cause of why the game is unplayable and have prepared a detailed, step-by-step plan for a junior developer to implement the necessary fixes.

### **Analysis: The Root of the Problem**

The "completed" tasks from your previous plan were implemented correctlyâ€”the code to *trigger* the AI's turn is now in `GameState.js`. However, the game is unplayable due to a critical logic flaw in how the AI's turn is handled.

**The core issue is that the AI takes only a single action and then the game halts.**

For example, the AI might correctly decide it needs to repay a loan. Its first action is to travel to the Bank. The `handleAIAction` method processes this "travel" action, the UI updates, and then... nothing happens. The AI has arrived at the Bank, but its turn is effectively over. It is never prompted to take its *next* action, which would be to actually repay the loan.

The game is now stuck, waiting for input for the AI player, which will never come.

### **The Path Forward: Creating a True AI Turn Loop**

To fix this, we need to create a proper turn loop for the AI. Instead of the AI taking just one action, the `GameState` must repeatedly ask the `AIController` for an action until the AI performs an action that ends its turn (like working a shift or choosing to rest).

Here is the step-by-step plan to implement this, making the game fully playable and robust.

### **Action Plan: Step-by-Step Implementation Guide**

#### [x] **Step 1: Create a New, Dedicated AI Turn Handler**

The current logic is mixed into the `endTurn` and `handleAIAction` methods. We will create a new, clearer method in `GameState.js` whose only job is to manage the AI's turn from start to finish.

*   **Why:** This centralizes the AI's logic, making it easier to understand and debug. It will contain the "loop" that keeps the AI's turn going.
*   **How:**
    1.  In the `js/game/GameState.js` file, create a new method called `processAITurn()`.
    2.  Inside this new method, start by getting the current player and logging that the AI is "thinking."
    3.  Call the `aiController.takeTurn()` method to get the AI's desired action.
    4.  Instead of a giant `switch` statement here, simply call the existing `handleAIAction()` method, passing the AI's chosen action to it.

#### [x] **Step 2: Modify `endTurn` to Use the New AI Handler**

Now, we'll change the `endTurn` method to kick off our new AI turn loop instead of just handling a single action.

*   **Why:** This properly separates the logic of ending a human's turn from the logic of processing an AI's turn.
*   **How:**
    1.  In `js/game/GameState.js`, go to the `endTurn()` method.
    2.  Find the `setTimeout` block that currently calls `handleAIAction`.
    3.  Change the code inside the `setTimeout` to call your new `processAITurn()` method instead.

#### [x] **Step 3: Refactor `handleAIAction` to Control the AI Loop**

This is the most critical step. We will change `handleAIAction` so that after it performs an action, it decides whether the AI's turn should continue. If it should, it will trigger another call to `processAITurn`.

*   **Why:** This creates the "loop." An action like "travel" shouldn't end the turn, so it must trigger the AI to think again. An action like "workShift" *does* end the turn, so it will stop the loop.
*   **How:**
    1.  In `js/game/GameState.js`, go to the `handleAIAction()` method.
    2.  At the end of each `case` in the `switch` statement, you need to decide what happens next.
    3.  For actions that **do not** end the turn (like `travel`, `deposit`, `withdraw`, `repayLoan`), add a `setTimeout` that calls `this.processAITurn()` again after a short delay (e.g., 1000ms). This gives the human player a moment to see what the AI did before it takes its next action.
    4.  For actions that **do** end the turn (like `workShift`, `takeCourse`, `buyItem`, `buyCar`), simply let the method finish. The turn will naturally pass to the next player when they click an action button.
    5.  The `default` case in the `switch` statement should call `this.endTurn()` to signify the AI is choosing to do nothing and end its turn.

#### [x] **Step 4: Complete the AI's Possible Actions**

The AI can currently decide to do things that the `handleAIAction` method doesn't know how to execute. We need to complete the `switch` statement to handle all possible AI decisions.

*   **Why:** If the `AIController` decides to `buyCar`, the game will currently do nothing because there is no `case 'buyCar'` in the `switch` statement. This is a hidden bug that will break the game loop.
*   **How:**
    1.  In `js/game/GameState.js`, review the `switch` statement inside `handleAIAction()`.
    2.  Compare the `case` statements to the possible actions the AI can choose in `js/game/AIController.js`.
    3.  You will notice that cases for `buyCar`, `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `takeLoan` are missing. Add a `case` block for each of these actions.
    4.  The code inside each new `case` block should call the corresponding `GameState` method (e.g., `case 'buyCar': this.buyCar(); break;`).
    5.  Remember to follow the logic from Step 3: after calling `this.buyCar()`, the turn should end. After `this.deposit()`, the turn should continue, so you will need to add the `setTimeout` to call `processAITurn()` again.

By following these four steps, you will transform the AI from a single-action player into one that can take a complete, logical turn. This will resolve the game-halting bug and result in a fully playable experience that meets the project's goals.
