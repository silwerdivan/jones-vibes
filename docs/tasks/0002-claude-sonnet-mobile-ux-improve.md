Let me analyze both screenshots - desktop and mobile views of what appears to be a game called "Jokes in the Fast Lane" or "Over Time".

Desktop view (first image):
- Two player panels side by side showing stats (Cash, Savings, Loan, Happiness, Education, Career, Car)
- Both players have 24 hours remaining
- Current Location and Turn information
- Action buttons (Rest/End Turn, Travel)
- Game Log at the bottom with cyan-colored action messages

Mobile view (second image):
- Title "OVER TIME"
- Two smaller player panels (P1 and AI) showing limited info ($ values and icons)
- Current Location: Employment Agency
- Turn: 1
- Game Log section (collapsed/hidden)
- Three buttons stacked: Rest/End Turn, Travel, Work Shift

User's concerns:
1. Viewport not being used effectively
2. Having to scroll to see game log - wants actions to pop up and fade
3. No way to see full player stats on mobile

Let me provide expert analysis on these issues and other observations.

Looking at both views, here's my analysis of the mobile layout issues and opportunities:

## Your Identified Issues

**1. Viewport efficiency:**
You're right - there's a lot of wasted vertical space. The player cards are compressed to just icons and basic cash values, leaving a large purple void in the middle. The desktop shows you can display much more information elegantly.

**2. Game Log scroll issue:**
Currently it's treated as a static container you need to scroll to. Your instinct about toast notifications is solid - actions should announce themselves where the player's attention already is, then archive into a scrollable log.

**3. Hidden player stats:**
This is a critical UX problem. Players likely need to reference their full stats frequently to make decisions. Right now, there's no indication these stats even exist or how to access them.

## Additional Issues I Notice

**Action button hierarchy is unclear:**
"Work Shift" appears after a gap, suggesting it might be contextual, but the visual separation doesn't clearly communicate this. On desktop, actions seem more integrated with context.

**Player differentiation is minimal:**
The tiny colored borders (green/purple) are the only distinguisher. On desktop, the larger panels with "PLAYER 1" and "PLAYER 2 (AI)" headers are much clearer.

**Location information feels disconnected:**
"Employment Agency" sits alone without context about what you can do there or why it matters.

## Suggested Improvements to Consider

**Player stats approach:**
- Make the player cards tappable/expandable accordions to reveal full stats
- OR use a hamburger/sheet that slides up from bottom
- OR implement horizontal swipe between summary and detail views
- Consider showing 1-2 additional key stats by default (maybe Happiness + Career given your game theme)

**Game log & notifications:**
- Float action results as temporary overlay cards/toasts in the center or top of screen
- Animate them in, hold briefly (3-4 seconds), fade into the log
- Make the Game Log a collapsible section with a badge showing unread action count
- Or replace Game Log container with a small "History" button that opens a modal

**Viewport optimization:**
- The player cards could be 30% larger without crowding
- Current Location could merge with Turn info in a single bar
- Consider if "Turn: 1" needs such prominence or could be smaller
- The action buttons could have icons + text for better scannability

**Context and flow:**
- Add a small hint under location about available actions ("You can work here" or "3 actions available")
- Consider a top bar with critical always-visible info (turn, time remaining)
- If "Work Shift" only appears at certain locations, add visual feedback (pulsing glow, "NEW" badge)

**Overall philosophy:**
The mobile view feels like it's hiding information rather than reorganizing it. Consider: what decisions does the player need to make *right now*? That info should be visible or one tap away. Everything else can be tucked behind progressive disclosure.

What game mechanics are most important for decision-making? That'll help prioritize what breaks through to the main view.
