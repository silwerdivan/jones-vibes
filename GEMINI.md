There's 3 very important markdown files:

- spec.md describes what we're building
- blueprint.md describes how we're building it (it contains prompts for each phase to be provided to the LLM)
- todo.md (keeps track of the progress of the project)

When initializing a git repository, always add a .gitignore file.
