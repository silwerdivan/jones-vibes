## Project Overview

This project is a browser-based, single-player vs. AI or two-player "hotseat" multiplayer game called **Jones in the Fast Lane** ‚Äî a modern, responsive reimagining of the classic 1990s life-simulation game.

Built entirely in **vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**, the game challenges players to achieve goals of wealth, happiness, education, and career advancement before their rival.

Key highlights of the architecture:

- **Turn-based gameplay loop** between one or two players (with AI capabilities).
- **Reactive decoupled architecture** powered by an internal `EventBus`.
- **Cross-platform responsive UI** supporting both desktop and mobile browsers.
- **Command Pattern**‚Äìbased input routing via an `InputManager`.
- **Single-direction data flow:** Input ‚Üí Controller ‚Üí GameState ‚Üí EventBus ‚Üí View.

The UI features a **retro synthwave aesthetic** combined with contemporary web design best practices ‚Äî such as fluid typography, responsive grid stacking, touch-friendly buttons, and accessibility-respecting relative units.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Layers

**1. Game State Layer (`GameState.js`)**

Holds all mutable game data (player stats, turn logic, finances, location, etc.).  
Implements all business rules and publishes updates through the global `EventBus`.

- Publishes events: `"stateChanged"`, `"aiThinkingStart"`, `"aiThinkingEnd"`, and `"gameOver"`.
- Handles AI-controlled turns via `AIController`.
- Implements the *Observer Pattern* and announces all changes reactively.

**2. Game Controller Layer (`GameController.js`)**

Acts as the mediator between inputs and game state.  
Receives abstracted input commands from the `InputManager`, invokes the relevant game logic, and in some cases triggers the `GameView` modal interfaces.

Implements *Command Pattern*‚Äìstyle methods like:
- `workShift()`
- `travel()`
- `buyItem()`
- `takeCourse()`
- `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, `takeLoan()`, `repayLoan()`, etc.

**3. Input System Layer (`InputManager.js`)**

A unified event handler that normalizes input handling across mouse and touch devices.

- Detects device type (touch vs. pointer)
- Uses a single event listener for efficient delegation
- Dispatches semantic, high-level game actions (instead of raw DOM events)
- Prevents mobile 300ms delay and accidental double triggering

**4. Event System (`EventBus.js`)**

Implements a lightweight publish/subscribe (Observer) system.

- Allows state and view to be fully decoupled
- Enables any module to listen for `publish('stateChanged', data)` updates
- Makes the architecture scalable, testable, and modular

**5. View Layer (`ui.js` ‚Üí `GameView` class)**

Purely reactive ‚Äî listens to `EventBus` events and re-renders UI elements.

- Dynamically updates DOM elements on `stateChanged`
- Displays modals for player choices, numeric inputs, and confirmations
- Shows and hides a responsive, full-viewport loading overlay when the AI is "thinking"
- Responsive actions panel becomes a sticky footer on smaller devices

**6. AI System (`AIController.js`)**

Implements simple strategic heuristics for computer-controlled turns.

Priorities:
1. Pay down large loans
2. Work to build wealth
3. Study to advance education
4. Shop to increase happiness
5. Purchase a car to improve travel efficiency
6. Pass turn if insufficient time or resources

## üì± Responsive Strategy

Adopts a **CSS Grid** and **intrinsic layout philosophy**:

- Desktop: `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr`
- Mobile: collapses into a stacked single-column layout at widths ‚â§ 768px
- `@media` queries dynamically reposition `.actions-panel` as a sticky bottom bar
- `clamp()` used for fluid typography and scalable padding
- Minimum tap targets (‚â• 44√ó44px)

Media query sections handle differences in interaction models and modal layout, ensuring consistent usability across devices.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running, Building, and Testing

### Run the Game
Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser (desktop or mobile).

### Testing
Jest is used for automated tests of `GameState`, `AIController`, and controller logic.

```bash
npm install
npm test
```
