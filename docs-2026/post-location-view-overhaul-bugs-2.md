there are some regression bugs after the last commit to implement @location-view-overhaul-spec.md

- when i clicked work shift, employment agency exited, should not happen, should stay open
- after applying for dishwasher, i could click it again, and it said congrats again, but i already have the job
- after ai's turn, i click next week button, then employment agency location opens immediately, this is wrong, because i'm at home
