there are some regression bugs after the last commit to implement @location-view-overhaul-spec.md

- when ai is done with turn, Ai is thinking overlay still shows, over the oh waht a weekend, so game is stuck.
- at employment agency, when applying for job, it closes the view, it should not, because user may still want to continue.
- there's a redundant apply button at the bottom.
- notification popups don't work anymore, because they display behind location view.
- the contextual-action-tray is still there, it's not needed anymore
- there needs to be a better, more intuitive way to end turn, i think with the original jones, when your time was up, your turn ended automatically.
